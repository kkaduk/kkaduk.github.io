* Deep understanding of Machine Learning 

It is a multipart post aimed to tidy and strengthen my current knowledge in the field of Machine Learning, particularly Deep Learning. So it is dedicated to my purpose to build compact knowledge for ongoing use. I will emphasize algorithms practical understanding based on simple python code (ready to play) and also the proper application and limitations of the algorithms. 
I do not write it for a particular audience (as an above explanation) but if someone finds useful for his/her purpose and find any mistake or a better idea to improve algorithm understanding, any comment highly appreciated.

My attendance on Coursera "Machine Learning" Courses profoundly influences the posts - "https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/DF4EQLR53HRB."

** Introduction
*** Artificial Intelligence history
This is AI history
*** AI human/business value
Is it a business value ?
*** AI ethics

** Computer language applied to machine learning review
*** Python (Pytorch)

This is python example 

#+begin_src python :results output
print ("Hello, world!")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello, world!


#+begin_src python :results file
import matplotlib, numpy
matplotlib.use('Agg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig=plt.figure(figsize=(4,2))
x=numpy.linspace(-15,15)
plt.plot(numpy.sin(x)/x)
fig.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('python-matplot-fig.png')
return 'python-matplot-fig.png' # return filename to org-mode
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:python-matplot-fig.png]]
